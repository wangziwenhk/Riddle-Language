A lightweight, flexible, and modern programming language.

Riddle Language is a memory-safe programming language designed to address the shortcomings of C/C++.

## Features

- **Memory Safety**: Riddle Language ensures memory safety at compile-time, eliminating common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows. This guarantees the robustness and security of software.
- **High Performance**: Riddle Language combines safety with high-performance execution, making it suitable for resource-intensive applications. This is achieved through advanced optimization and a well-designed runtime system.
- **Concise and Expressive**: Riddle Language offers a concise and expressive syntax that enhances code readability and maintainability. It provides modern language constructs, powerful abstractions, and a rich library set to simplify the development process.
- **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Riddle Language has built-in support for concurrent and parallel programming. It offers lightweight threads, asynchronous programming models, and synchronization primitives, making it easier to develop scalable and efficient applications.
- **Interoperability**: Riddle Language seamlessly integrates with existing codebases and libraries written in other languages. It provides simple bindings to C and C++ and supports interoperability with popular frameworks and ecosystems.
